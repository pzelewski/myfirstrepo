# timeseries-shifts

Objectives:

1.
Develop a software solution for computing S(f,g), as defined in the .pdf file, for two time nonnegative series f,g on [0,n).
Use Theorem 1.3, 1.7, 3.7 to test and QA the solution.

Nice to have:
Explore replacing the recursion from the FFT method (Corollary 3.13) with a more native recursion.

2.
Confirm numerically  Theorem 4.4.

3.
Use Theorem 4.4 to find the lenght l of fundamental period.
